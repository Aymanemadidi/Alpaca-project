# Alpaca-project

Live Demo: https://whimsical-platypus-2b8a1a.netlify.app/

Introduction
At DevProjects, we love alpacas! It's our mascot, and we'd love for you to have your own alpaca profile photo. With that said, this project is not just about alpacas. Allowing users to generate and download avatars are common in many interactive websites. In this project, you'll learn how to create an image generator website that allows users to generate, combine, and download images.

This project should take you approximately 8 hours to complete.

Requirements
A website to let you customize your own alpaca profile picture (or desired image)
Customization panel
Randomize feature
Download generated image feature
The following GIF shows one way to implement the UI. Feel free to interpret the requirements however you'd like!
